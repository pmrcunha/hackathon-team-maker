# Hackathon Team Maker

![Weekend Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/kind-weekend_project-blue)

When organizing an Hackathon at work, we needed a way to help collect ideas and 
organize teams, and I had the idea of building this app.
Thanks to AI, I built it in less than one day, but still gave myself the chance
to experiment with some tech I had not tried before, namely [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/) and [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/).
